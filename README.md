# **Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance**

The Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance (CASA) is a collection of working groups dedicated blockchain protocol-agnostic standards. CASA also publishes [Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs) which describe standards created by the different working groups.

## **Purpose**

CASA is a self-organized and autonomous alliance of crypto-blockchain developers and enthusiasts. Its aim to create standards which support interoperability and facilitate communication between blockchain protocols, software and companies.

CASA organizes working groups where proposals are debated, drafted and submitted as CAIPs for the purpose implementation and community adoption.

## **Organizational Structure**

CASA participants are structured into three groups:

| Role           | Description                                                                                     |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Members        | All participants who contribute in any form, including github review. Expected to participate in one or more topical working groups. |
| Working Groups | Topical clusters of CAIPs and namespaces. These change over time according to activity          |
| Editoral board/"Codeowners" | A subset of membership including the authors of accepted CAIPs committed to ongoing review and maintainance of the CAIPs and namespaces |

<a name="meetings"></a>

### **Regular Meetings**

All CASA stakeholders are invited to join our regular editorial meetings every four weeks, as well as regular meetings of the more focused topical working groups, which meet every 2 or every 4 weeks depending on the consensus of the group. These take place on jitsi, and a calendar can be found [here](https://bit.ly/thepubliccasacalendar) (also [here](https://bit.ly/thecasacalendar) for Google Calendar users). Where possible, high-level minutes are taken, and entered into the notes as [closed issues](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CASA/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) on this repo.

We also have periodic in-person meetings, to onboard new participants and, where possible, to advance working group progress. For information on these, see the `Gatherings` repository.

#### **Explicit and Implicit Agendas**

1. Explicit agenda items, if any have been set by issues in the `meetings/` repo (e.g., instance, a working group requests the whole community's input on a decision).
1. Implicit agenda: PRs in the `CAIPs/` repo that have been marked as "next meeting" or "merge soon" by the `CAIPs/` codeowners and/or Maintainers.
1. Implicit agenda: Issues in the `CAIPs/` repo that have been marked as "next meeting", as time allows.
1. Housekeeping, agenda requests for the following meeting, and open discussion.

*Note: the purpose of the `next meeting` tag is to allow codeowners to prioritize or stack-rank additions. Codeowners and the broader membership alike are requested to use them to prioritize them in their review process to allow swift review. Approval by any 2 codeowners is enough to merge at a future meeting. In cases where a timely merge is desired, codeowners may also chose to apply a `merge soon` tag, which is a way of requesting more review for an approved PR (and avoid a valid PR sitting unmerged across multiple meetings for lack of discussion).*

## **Discord Server**

For those who prefer realtime/social-style communications, we also run a Discord server, which is secondary and non-archival-- it can be found using [this Discord invite link](https://discord.gg/-remove-this-KxqKHppC39) _(note: this link has a spam/crawler deterrent that requires manual removal)_.
